Punisher
--------

__Punisher hurts you where it hurts most - your time.__

Punisher aims to penalise bad habits by sleeping for an increasingly longer
delay as the infringements mount. You have to :Atone for your sins to reset
the delay.

Example
~~~~~~~

Put this in ++~/.vim/plugin/punishments.vim++ to train you out of the
habit of using   ++A<CR>++   when you should be using   ++o++
instead:

  nnoremap <expr> A Penalty('A')
  inoremap <expr> <cr> Punish("\<cr>")
