Punisher hurts you where it hurts most - your time.

Punisher aims to penalise bad habits by sleeping for an increasingly longer
delay as the infringements mount. You have to :Atone for your sins to reset
the delay.

EXAMPLE~

Put this in ~/.vim/plugin/punishments.vim to train you out of the habit of
using   A<CR>   when you should be using   o   instead:
>
  nnoremap <expr> A Penalty('A')
  inoremap <expr> <cr> Punish("\<cr>")
